# Solopreneur Personal Operating System Prompt

> Adapted for vibecoding consultants and content creators running "Ambitious Realism"

---

I want you to autonomously build a PERSONAL OPERATING SYSTEM for a solopreneur.

This is NOT a SaaS app, NOT a startup framework, and NOT productivity theater. It is a private, single-user, high-trust personal operating system designed for a solopreneur who works as a vibecoding consultant and content creator — someone who builds with AI tools, serves clients, creates in public, and wants to run "Ambitious Realism" as their operating philosophy.

**Ambitious Realism** means: Dream big enough to matter, stay honest enough to execute. No toxic optimism, no playing small. Clear-eyed about capacity, committed to meaningful progress.

The purpose of this system is to help me reflect, define goals, run daily and weekly check-ins, review past performance, design my ideal future, balance client work with personal building, track creative output, manage energy as a solo operator, and maintain clarity without bureaucracy or self-deception.

You are building a SYSTEM, not software.

Your output should feel like a thoughtful advisor who understands solo work — calm, direct, insightful, and honest. Not a coach who's never shipped anything. Not a therapist. Not a productivity guru. Someone who knows what it's like to be the entire operation.

Do NOT ask me any questions. Make reasonable assumptions for a solopreneur who:
- Works primarily through AI-assisted development (vibecoding with Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
- Runs consulting projects for clients
- Creates content about AI tools and workflows
- Values time freedom alongside meaningful output
- Is in a building/growth phase, not maintenance mode

Document all assumptions in the system itself.

The system must support daily check-ins, weekly reviews, quarterly goal reviews, annual reflection and planning, ingestion of past documents, guided self-interviews, framework-based thinking, and long-term life design — all using plain language, conversational prompts, markdown files, and a simple folder structure.

## FRAMEWORKS TO INCORPORATE

Adapt thoughtfully, credit sources:

**Core Frameworks:**
- Dr. Anthony Gustin's Annual Review framework
- Tim Ferriss's Ideal Lifestyle Costing  
- Tony Robbins–style Vivid Vision thinking
- Alex Lieberman's Life Map (career, relationships, health, meaning, finances, fun)

**Solo-Specific Additions:**
- **Leverage Audit**: Where is AI doing the heavy lifting? Where am I still doing $20/hour work?
- **Energy Architecture**: Solo work has no buffer. Map energy types (creative, administrative, client-facing, learning) to time blocks.
- **Client vs Creator Balance**: Consulting pays now, content compounds later. Track the ratio.
- **Learning Investment**: Vibecoding requires constant tool evaluation. How much R&D time is productive vs procrastination?
- **Regret Minimization**: Bezos-style "what will 80-year-old me think?" for big decisions
- **Personal Advisory Board**: The 3-5 people (real or imagined) whose judgment you trust for different domains
- **Ambient Revenue vs Active Income**: How much money requires your presence vs runs without you?

## INTERVIEW DESIGN

Design interview-style scripts with questions like:

- "What actually shipped this year versus what you talked about shipping?"
- "Where did AI tools give you leverage? Where did you use them to procrastinate?"
- "What client work energized you? What client work you'd never take again?"
- "What content performed versus what you wanted to perform? What does that tell you?"
- "Where are you still doing work that AI should be doing?"
- "What would you build if you had no clients for 3 months?"
- "What's the honest gap between your public persona and your private reality?"
- "If this year repeated 10 times, would you be proud of the trajectory?"
- "What are you avoiding because it's hard, not because it's wrong?"
- "Where are you being ambitious? Where are you being realistic? Are those calibrated correctly?"

These interviews should feel like a sharp friend who's also a builder — not judgmental, but not letting you bullshit yourself either.

---

## DAILY CHECK-IN (5 minutes max)

- Energy level (1-10) and energy type available (creative / administrative / depleted)
- One thing that moved real needle today
- One thing that felt like work but wasn't actually valuable
- Am I in client-mode, creator-mode, or recovery-mode? Is that right for today?
- One thing to let go of
- Tomorrow's single most important thing

---

## WEEKLY REVIEW

- What actually shipped (code, content, client deliverables)?
- What moved business forward vs felt productive?
- Client work hours vs personal building hours — is the ratio right?
- Where did time leak? (Twitter rabbit holes, tool evaluation that was actually procrastination, etc.)
- One insight about how I work best
- One adjustment for next week
- Energy debt check: Am I borrowing from future weeks?

---

## MONTHLY REVIEW (instead of quarterly for faster solo cycles)

- Revenue reality check: What came in? From what sources?
- Goal progress: Am I on track for the year?
- Leverage audit: Where did AI tools save me? Where am I still manual?
- Content performance: What resonated? What flopped? Any patterns?
- Client satisfaction: Any feedback? Any scope creep? Any projects to end?
- Energy pattern: What times/conditions produced best work?
- Learning ROI: What new tools/skills actually paid off vs shiny object syndrome?
- Course correction: What needs to change in the next 30 days?

---

## ANNUAL REVIEW

- Full Gustin-style reflection (wins, losses, lessons, gratitudes)
- Updated Life Map across all 6 domains
- Ideal Lifestyle Costing refresh (what does your ideal year actually cost?)
- Vivid Vision update (what does 3 years from now look like in detail?)
- Honest capacity check: What did you consistently NOT do despite saying you would?
- Ambitious Realism calibration: Where to aim higher? Where to be more honest about limits?
- Narrative summary: What's the story of this year in 3 paragraphs?
- Intent for next year: Not goals yet, just direction and energy allocation

---

## MEMORY AND PATTERN DETECTION

The system must:

- Allow upload of past reviews, notes, journal entries
- Extract patterns: repeated goals that never happen, consistent energy drains, actual strengths vs aspirational strengths
- Generate an "Honest Pattern Summary" — what the data actually shows about how you work
- Store key insights in memory.md
- Reference these patterns in future check-ins ("You've set this goal 3 years running and never hit it — what's actually going on?")

---

## TONE AND PHILOSOPHY

- Calm, direct, zero bullshit
- No hustle culture ("crush it", "grind", "10x")
- No therapy speak ("holding space", "honoring yourself")
- No productivity porn (complex systems, dashboard fetishism)
- Ambitious Realism throughout: honest about capacity, committed to meaningful progress
- Acknowledge solo work reality: no team to blame, no team to delegate to, full autonomy = full responsibility
- Treat AI tools as genuine leverage, not magic
- Respect that time freedom and meaningful output can coexist

---

## README REQUIREMENTS

The README.md must explain:

- How to use this system daily (5 min), weekly (30 min), monthly (2 hours), annually (half day)
- How to personalize in under 15 minutes
- The Ambitious Realism philosophy in plain language
- How to upload past documents and generate pattern summaries
- That this is a private system — honesty is the only rule

---

## COMPLETION CRITERIA

This is complete when a solopreneur can:

1. Receive a complete personal operating system
2. Begin using it immediately with zero technical knowledge
3. Experience more clarity rather than more overwhelm
4. Have honest mirrors for their work without external accountability theater
5. Track what actually matters for solo building: energy, leverage, output, and life balance

---

Begin by creating the folder structure and README.md, then populate every file with thoughtful, high-quality content. Make it feel like it was built by someone who understands solo work, not corporate productivity consultants.

Go.
