## 1. Dr. Anthony Gustin's Annual Review Framework

### Philosophy
- **Reflection over Goal-Setting**: Deep reflection makes correct goals obvious
- **Systems over Targets**: Build environments that make success inevitable
- **"Cutting the Noise"**: See patterns clearly and act decisively

### The Methodology

#### Data Gathering (Pre-Review)
Review these sources to spark memory:
- **Calendar**: Every meeting, event, trip
- **Photos**: Where you were, how you felt
- **Journals/Notes**: Internal state throughout the year
- **Credit Card Statements**: Where money (priorities) went

#### The Four Buckets
Categorize every major event, habit, or occurrence:
1. **Wins**: Accomplishments and moments of pride
2. **Losses**: Mistakes, "anti-accomplishments," things that didn't go as planned
3. **Lessons**: The "why" behind wins and losses; what you learned
4. **Gratitudes**: What you're thankful for (often people or opportunities)

### 13 Life Categories (Evaluate Current vs Desired State)
1. Values & Purpose
2. Contribution & Impact
3. Location & Stuff
4. Finances & Money
5. Career & Work
6. Health & Fitness
7. Education & Skill Development
8. Social Life & Relationships
9. Emotions & Mindfulness
10. Character & Identity
11. Productivity & Organization
12. Adventure & Creativity
13. Spirituality

### Key Questions
- "What did I do this year that I want to do MORE of?"
- "What did I do this year that I want to do LESS of?"
- "Who did I spend the most time with? Did they energize or drain me?"
- "What was the single biggest bottleneck to my growth this year?"
- "If I could repeat the year, what ONE thing would I change?"
- "What am I most afraid of in the coming year?"

### Planning Phase Outputs
1. **The "Stop" List**: Habits, people, projects to cut
2. **The "Start" List**: New initiatives based on lessons
3. **Theme of the Year**: Single word/phrase as North Star
4. **90-Day Targets**: Breaking down categories into actionable items

### Time Investment
- **Minimum**: 3-5 uninterrupted hours
- **Recommended**: Half-day to full day in different location
- **Frequency**: Annually (Thanksgiving to first week of January)

## 2. Tim Ferriss's Ideal Lifestyle Costing (TMI)

### Core Concept: Dreamlining
Apply time-bound (6 or 12 months) and cost-based constraints to specific dreams. Calculate the exact dollar amount needed for your ideal life.

### The HAVING / BEING / DOING Framework

| Category | Definition | Rule |
|----------|------------|------|
| **HAVING** | Material desires, possessions | Focus on monthly cost (lease/loan), not total price |
| **BEING** | Skills, traits, states of existence | MUST convert to a "Doing" to be measurable |
| **DOING** | Experiences, activities, accomplishments | Things to do with time and mobility |

### TMI Calculation Methodology

**Step 1**: Define Timelines (6-month and 12-month)

**Step 2**: List 5 items per category (Having/Being/Doing)
- Prompt: "What would you do if there were no way you could fail?"
- Prompt: "What would you do with $100 million in the bank?"

**Step 3**: Convert "Being" to "Doing"
- Example: "Being a great cook" → "Cooking a 5-course dinner for friends"

**Step 4**: Calculate Monthly Costs
- One-time costs: Divide by months in timeline
- Recurring costs: Use monthly amount

**Step 5**: Factor in Expenses + Buffer
- Current monthly expenses × 1.3 (30% safety buffer)

**Step 6**: The Formula
```
TMI = (Total Monthly Cost of Dreams) + [1.3 × (Current Monthly Expenses)]
TDI = TMI / 30  (Target Daily Income)
```

### Example Worksheet
| Category | Item | Monthly Cost |
|----------|------|--------------|
| HAVING | Personal Assistant (10 hrs/wk) | $400 |
| HAVING | Designer Wardrobe (one-time $1.2k) | $200 |
| BEING→DOING | Spanish fluency (tutor) | $300 |
| DOING | Croatian Coast trip | $500 |
| **SUBTOTAL A** | Dream Costs | **$1,400** |
| **SUBTOTAL B** | Living Expenses | **$3,000** |
| **FORMULA** | (B × 1.3) + A | $3,900 + $1,400 |
| **TMI** | | **$5,300** |

### Key Insight
TMI is almost always LOWER than expected, removing the psychological barrier that "freedom" requires millions.

## 3. Cameron Herold's Vivid Vision Framework

### Core Concept
A 3-5 page detailed description of what your life/business will look, feel, and act like 3 years from now. NOT a mission statement—a sensory-rich narrative.

### The 4-Step Process
1. **Step Away from Your Desk**: Go to inspiring, distraction-free environment
2. **Imagine 3 Years in the Future**: It is exactly 3 years from today
3. **Cover All Areas**: Culture, workspace, customer experience, industry "buzz"
4. **Write with Passion**: Make the reader FEEL the excitement

### Mandatory Rules
- **PRESENT TENSE**: "Our revenue is..." NOT "Our revenue will be..."
- **Length**: 3-5 pages (shorter lacks detail; longer loses attention)
- **The "How" Ban**: NO strategies, roadmaps, or how-to steps. Only the DESTINATION.

### Domains to Cover
1. The Big Why & Snapshot
2. Culture & Team
3. Products & Services
4. Sales & Marketing
5. Operations
6. Financials (state, not strategy)
7. Media & Awards
8. Community & Giving

### Writing Prompts
- "What does your workspace look like 3 years from now?"
- "What do people say about your work when you're not in the room?"
- "How do you feel waking up on a Tuesday morning?"
- "What types of problems do you solve? What 'flow' do you achieve?"
- "What are customers saying in their testimonials?"
- "What does the media write about you?"

### Complementary: Tony Robbins Priming (10-min Morning)
1. **Breathwork** (3 min): 3 sets of 30 sharp nasal exhales
2. **Gratitude** (3 min): Feel 3 things (one must be small)
3. **Goal Visualization** (3 min): 3 goals from Vivid Vision as ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED

## 4. Alex Lieberman's Life Map Framework

### Philosophy
An adaptation of EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System) for personal life. Makes trade-offs between business success and personal fulfillment VISIBLE. "Don't accidentally neglect your marriage while crushing your startup."

### The 6 Domains
1. **Career** - Professional growth, intellectual challenge, long-term trajectory
2. **Relationships** - Quality of connection with partner, family, close friends
3. **Health** - Physical vitality, mental well-being, energy levels
4. **Meaning** - Purpose, impact, alignment with core values
5. **Finances** - Financial security, wealth building, freedom from anxiety
6. **Fun** - Pure play, recreation, activities done solely for enjoyment

### Scoring Methodology
- **Scale**: 1-10 for each domain
- **Question**: "On a scale of 1-10, how satisfied am I with this area today?"
- **Frequency**: Annual Review (full), Quarterly (light check-in)
- **Key Rule**: Ruthless self-honesty. A 10 in Career often hides a 3 in Relationships.

### Gap Analysis: "The Road to 10"
For each domain, ask: **"What would it take to make this a 10?"**

This forces:
- Moving from vague ("unhappy with health") to specific ("hire a trainer")
- The delta (current score vs 10) becomes your 90-day goals ("Rocks")

### Missing vs Maintenance Classification

| Type | Definition | Example | Action |
|------|------------|---------|--------|
| **Missing (Growth)** | Foundational element absent, score low | Single wanting partner, hating job | High intensity, new habits, "building" energy |
| **Maintenance (Protection)** | Currently satisfied (8+), needs ongoing effort | Best shape of life | Consistency, SOPs, "protective" energy |

### Domain-Specific Audit Questions

| Domain | Questions |
|--------|-----------|
| **Career** | Am I intellectually challenged? Building a "personal moat"? Working with people who make me better? |
| **Relationships** | Am I a "kickass" partner/parent? Friends I can be my full self with? Am I present when with them? |
| **Health** | Feel good waking up? Energy to sustain a 12-hour day? Is my "mental health stack" working? |
| **Meaning** | If my work repeated for 100 years, would the world be better? Daily effort align with core values? |
| **Finances** | Secure enough to say "no" to things I don't want? Is money working for me, or me for it? |
| **Fun** | When did I last do something just for the sake of it? Am I "playing" enough? |

### Process Flow
1. **Vision**: Define what "10" looks like in each bucket (10-Year Vision)
2. **Audit**: Score current status (1-10)
3. **Classify**: Mark each as "Missing" or "Maintenance"
4. **Prioritize**: Choose 1-3 "Missing" buckets for next 90 days
5. **Execute**: Set "Rocks" (tactical goals) to move toward 10

## 5. Energy Architecture (Solo Module)

### Energy Type Classifications

| Type | Description | Best Activities |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Creative** | Deep work capacity, highest cognitive load | Coding, writing, strategy |
| **Administrative** | Logic and precision | Email, meetings, AI-assisted tasks |
| **Recovery** | Deliberately off | Rest, reading, family |

### Time-to-Energy Mapping
- **Peak (Focus 8-10)**: Reserve for Deep Work (morning for most)
- **Trough (Focus ≤5)**: Mid-afternoon. Admin, email, low-stakes calls
- **Rebound**: Late afternoon/evening. Maintenance, system building

### Ideal Week Template Structure
| Day | AM (Creative) | Midday (Admin) | PM (Recovery) |
|-----|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Mon | | | |
| Tue | | | |
| Wed | | | |
| Thu | | | |
| Fri | | | |

### Energy Debt Warning Signs
- Decision fatigue (can't make simple choices)
- Attention residue (foggy when switching tasks)
- Emotional fragility (irritability, lack of motivation)

### Recovery Strategies
1. **Conserve**: "Hell Yeah or No" for new commitments
2. **Recharge**: Non-negotiable recovery rituals (Shutdown Ritual)
3. **Align**: Ensure projects match internal values
4. **Slow Productivity**: Fewer things, natural pace, obsess over quality

## 6. Leverage Audit (Solo Module)

### The 2x Rule
If AI interaction takes longer than 2× manual execution (including debugging), it's **productivity theater**.

### Skill-Leverage Matrix
| Work Value | AI Strategy |
|------------|-------------|
| **$10/hr work** (scheduling, data entry) | KILL or AUTOMATE |
| **$100/hr work** (tweaks, basic writing) | AUTOMATE (Cyborg/Centaur) |
| **$1,000/hr work** (specialized consulting) | AUGMENT (Cyborg) |
| **$10,000/hr work** (strategy, unique IP) | PROTECT (Human-Only) |

### Cyborg vs Centaur (Ethan Mollick Research)

**Centaur (Strategic Decoupling)**
- Divide-and-conquer: Switch between Human and AI
- Clear "hand-off" points
- Best for: Structured tasks with clear boundaries
- Example: "AI writes draft, Human edits for tone"

**Cyborg (Deep Integration)**
- Intertwined: You + AI work together on every sub-step
- Lower context-switching, continuous interaction
- Best for: Creative/complex tasks with non-linear paths
- Risk: Drifting into AI-generated mediocrity

### Red Flags for Productivity Theater
- **2x Rule Violation**: Total time (Prompt + Monitor + Correct) > 2× manual
- **Workslop**: High-volume, low-substance output no one reads
- **Prompt Engineering Loop**: More time tuning prompt than writing output
- **Quality Ceiling**: 90% correct = failure for critical details

### Kill / Automate / Protect Framework
**KILL**: Tasks that don't move needle on high-value work
**AUTOMATE**: The boring 30% (rules-based, repetitive)
**PROTECT**: Deep empathy, rare taste, strategic insight, high-stakes judgment

### Audit Questions
1. "If I had to do this manually today, how long would it take?"
2. "Does the 10% human polish provide 90% of the value?"
3. "Is this output actually useful, or just space-filler?"
4. "Is my ability to do this manually degrading?"
5. "Is this building a system that works while I sleep?"

## 7. Interview Script Design Principles

### The "What" Over "Why" Rule
- **WHY questions** → rumination, confabulation, self-bias
- **WHAT questions** → objective reality, future-oriented solutions

| Bad (Rumination) | Good (Action) |
|------------------|---------------|
| "Why can't I finish projects?" | "What specifically distracted me during the last 3 sessions?" |
| "Why am I stressed?" | "What's the worst-case I can actually prepare for now?" |
| "Do I even like this job?" | "What tasks gave me energy this week? What took it away?" |

### The "Best Friend Filter"
Question: "If my best friend were watching me right now, what would they say I am lying to myself about?"

Why it works: Bypasses ego's defense mechanisms.

### Interview Structure (4 Phases)
1. **Fact-Finding (The Deposition)**: "What happened? What did I say? What were results?"
2. **Pattern Recognition (The Detective)**: "When have I seen this movie before?"
3. **Best Friend Filter (The Truth-Teller)**: "What am I pretending not to know?"
4. **Decision Engineering (The Strategist)**: "What's the next logical move in 24 hours?"

### Questions That Drive Action
| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Outcome-Based** | "What does successful resolution look like in 3 months?" |
| **Constraint-Based** | "If I could only change ONE thing, what would it be?" |
| **Agency-Based** | "What part is 100% within my control to change today?" |
| **Cost-Based** | "What's the specific cost of doing nothing for 30 more days?" |

### Anti-Patterns
- **Ruminative Loop**: Questions with no definitive answer
- **Feeling Trap**: "How do I feel?" over "What is reality?"
- **Vague Intentions**: "Be better" instead of "20 min on X every morning"
- **Confirmation Bias**: Questions leading to pre-decided conclusions

### Every Interview MUST End With
- Stop / Start / Continue decisions
- Specific commitments with timeframes
- NOT feelings or insights alone
