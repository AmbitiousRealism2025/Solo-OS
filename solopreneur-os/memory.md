# Memory - Pattern Detection System

> Your external brain for patterns, experiments, and decisions. The connective tissue of the system.

## How This Works

```
Signal (Individual Observation)
    ↓ seen 3+ times
Pattern (Distilled Synthesis)
    ↓ design hypothesis
Experiment (Behavioral Test)
    ↓ evaluate results
Decision (Workflow Change)
```

| Stage | What It Is | Cadence |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Signal** | Raw observation worth tracking | Daily (1-3 max) |
| **Pattern** | Recurring cluster with evidence | Weekly promotion |
| **Experiment** | Hypothesis being tested | Monthly design |
| **Decision** | Irreversible-ish choice + rationale | As needed |

---

## Promotion Criteria

When to promote a signal to a pattern:

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Frequency (Rule of 3)** | Seen 3+ times within 30 days |
| **Resonance** | Persistent hunch or physical sensation of relevance |
| **Actionability** | Can apply to 2+ different projects/areas |
| **Risk/Value** | Directly impacts safety, finances, or core goals |

---

## Active Signals

<!-- Add 1-3 bullets per day max. Review weekly. Promote when criteria met. -->

### Recent Signals

- 

---

## Confirmed Patterns

<!-- Promoted from signals when seen 3+ times with clear evidence -->

### Pattern: [Name]

- **Evidence**: Seen on [dates/contexts]
- **Trigger**: What causes this?
- **Impact**: How does this affect outcomes?
- **Action**: What to do about it?
- **Status**: Active / Resolved / Monitoring

---

## Running Experiments

<!-- Hypotheses with clear stop conditions. Max 3 active at once. -->

### Experiment: [Name]

- **Hypothesis**: If I [action], then [expected result]
- **Start Date**: 
- **Review Date**: 
- **Stop Condition**: 
- **Current Status**: [ ] Running [ ] Succeeded [ ] Failed [ ] Abandoned
- **Notes**: 

---

## Decisions Log

<!-- Irreversible-ish choices with reasoning. Future you will thank present you. -->

### Decision: [Title]

- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Status**: Proposed / Accepted / Superseded / Deprecated
- **Context**: The specific problem or signal that prompted this
- **Choice**: What was decided
- **Alternatives Considered**: What was rejected and why
- **Consequences**: What is the new reality
- **Review Date**: When to evaluate if this is still working

## Archive

### Resolved Patterns

<!-- Patterns that led to decisions and are now incorporated into workflow -->

### Completed Experiments

<!-- Experiments that concluded with clear results -->

### Superseded Decisions

<!-- Decisions that were replaced by newer ones -->

## Maintenance Schedule

| Cadence | Activity | Goal |
|---------|----------|------|
| **Daily** | Add 1-3 signals max | Capture without overwhelm |
| **Weekly** | Review signals, look for clusters | Promote to emerging patterns |
| **Monthly** | Review patterns, design 1 experiment | Test hypotheses |
| **Quarterly** | Review decision log, assess system | Strategic adjustment |

## Pattern Detection Questions

Use during reviews to surface hidden patterns:

- "You've set this goal 3 times and never hit it. What's actually going on?"
- "This is the Nth time you've burned out in Q4. What's the pattern?"
- "Every project with X characteristic has gone poorly. Stop taking them?"
- "What type of work consistently energizes you? What drains you?"
- "What triggers your worst decisions? Your best ones?"

## Quick Reference

### Tag Usage

| Tag | When to Use |
|-----|-------------|
| `#signal` | Raw observation, first instance |
| `#pattern` | 3+ instances, promoted from signals |
| `#experiment` | Active hypothesis being tested |
| `#decision` | Irreversible-ish choice made |
