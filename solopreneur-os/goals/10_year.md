# 10-Year Vision

> Long-term direction. Compass, not GPS. **Update: Every 2-3 years or at major inflection points.**

## Purpose

This isn't a plan—it's a direction. You won't predict 10 years accurately. But having a direction prevents drift.

The goal: When faced with a decision, you can ask "Does this move me toward or away from my 10-year vision?"

## Decision Filter

Use this vision as a filter for major decisions:

**"Does this move me toward my 10-year vision?"**

| If YES | If NO | If UNCLEAR |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Strong signal to proceed | Strong signal to decline | Ask: "What information would make this clear?" |

---

## Flexibility Clause

This vision will change. That's fine. The purpose is direction, not prediction.

**Review triggers:**
- Every 2-3 years (mandatory)
- Major life inflection (job change, relationship change, location change)
- When current direction feels misaligned

**When updating:**
- Don't delete the old vision—archive it
- Note what changed and why
- Check if values shifted or just circumstances

## Connection to Shorter Horizons

| Horizon | Document | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| 10 Years | This document | Direction |
| 3 Years | [3-Year Goals](3_year.md) | Strategy |
| 1 Year | [1-Year Goals](1_year.md) | Execution |
| 90 Days | [Life Map Rocks](../frameworks/life_map.md) | Tactics |

**Alignment check:** Do your shorter-horizon goals serve this 10-year vision?
