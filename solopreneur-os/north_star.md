## Your North Star

<!-- 
Write your North Star below. This is the one thing that, if you achieved it, 
would make everything else either easier or unnecessary.

Keep it to 1-2 sentences. If you can't say it simply, you don't know it yet.

**My North Star is:**

## What Makes a Good North Star

| Characteristic | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Singular** | One direction, not five. You can only walk one path. |
| **Meaningful** | Connects to what you actually care about, not what sounds good. |
| **Directional** | Points the way, doesn't describe the destination in detail. |
| **Stable** | Doesn't change every quarter. Should last 3-10 years. |
| **Honest** | What you actually want, not what you think you should want. |

## The Decision Test

When facing a choice, ask:

> "Does this move me toward my North Star, or away from it?"

- **Toward** → Consider doing it
- **Away** → Consider not doing it
- **Neutral** → Probably not worth your time

## Examples (For Inspiration Only)

These are examples. Yours should be yours.

- "Build a business that runs without me, so I can focus on what I'm uniquely good at."
- "Create work that compounds—where each thing I make increases the value of everything else."
- "Achieve financial independence while doing work I'd do for free."
- "Build a body of work that outlasts me."

## When to Revisit

**Revisit annually** during your Annual Review, or when:

- A major life event changes your priorities
- You achieve your current North Star (time to set a new one)
- You realize you've been lying to yourself about what you want

**Don't revisit** every time things get hard. Discomfort isn't a signal to change direction.
