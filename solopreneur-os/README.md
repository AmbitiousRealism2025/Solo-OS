# Solopreneur Personal Operating System

> Dream big enough to matter, stay honest enough to execute.

---

## What This Is

A private, single-user operating system for solopreneurs. Not productivity theater. Not a SaaS app. An honest mirror for your work.

**Built on Ambitious Realism**: No toxic optimism. No playing small. Clear-eyed about capacity. Committed to meaningful progress.

---

## Quick Start (15 minutes)

1. **Read the philosophy** — [Ambitious Realism](ambitious_realism.md) (5 min)
2. **Set your direction** — [North Star](north_star.md) (5 min)
3. **Do your first check-in** — [Daily Template](reviews/daily/template.md) (5 min)

That's it. You're using the system.

## How to Use This System

| Cadence | Time | File | Purpose |
|---------|------|------|---------|
| **Daily** | ≤5 min | [Daily Check-In](reviews/daily/template.md) | Energy + needle mover + tomorrow's MIT |
| **Weekly** | 30-60 min | [Weekly Review](reviews/weekly/template.md) | What shipped + ratio check + adjustments |
| **Monthly** | 60-120 min | [Monthly Review](reviews/monthly/template.md) | Revenue + trends + course correction |
| **Annually** | Half day | [Annual Review](reviews/annual/template.md) | Full reset + vision refresh |

**Timeboxes are sacred.** If a review takes longer, cut content. Don't extend time.

## Personalization

1. **Adjust your principles** — [Principles](principles.md) (add 3-5 personal rules)
2. **Set your North Star** — [North Star](north_star.md) (your singular direction)
3. **Know your ratios** — Set your target Client:Creator hours in [Metrics Dictionary](tracking/metrics_dictionary.md)

Lie to others if you must. Never lie to this system. It can only help you if you tell it the truth.
