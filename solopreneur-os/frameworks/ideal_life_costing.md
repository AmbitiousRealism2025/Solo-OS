# Ideal Life Costing Framework

> Tim Ferriss's TMI methodology: Calculate the exact dollar amount needed for your ideal life. **Timebox: 60-90 minutes.**

---

## Philosophy

- **Dreamlining**: Apply time-bound and cost-based constraints to specific dreams
- **The Insight**: TMI is almost always LOWER than expected
- **The Block Removed**: "Freedom" doesn't require millions—just clarity on the number

---

## Core Concept

Most people avoid defining their ideal life because they assume it's unaffordable. This framework forces specificity, and specificity reveals that the target is often closer than imagined.

---

## Part 1: Define Your Timeline

Choose your planning horizon:

- [ ] **6 Months** (aggressive, focused)
- [ ] **12 Months** (standard)

**Timeline Selected**: ______ months

---

## Part 2: The Three Lists

### HAVING (Material Desires)

Things you want to own or access. Focus on **monthly cost**, not total price.

| Item | One-Time Cost | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| | $ | $ | |
| | $ | $ | |
| | $ | $ | |
| | $ | $ | |
| | $ | $ | |

**Prompts to spark ideas:**
- What would you buy if money were no object?
- What possessions would make daily life easier?
- What have you been putting off purchasing?

### BEING (Skills, Traits, States)

Who you want to become. **Must convert to a "Doing" to be measurable.**

| Being | Converted to Doing |
|-------|-------------------|
| "Be fluent in Spanish" | "Complete 30 Spanish lessons with tutor" |
| "Be a great cook" | "Cook 5-course dinner for friends by June" |
| "Be physically fit" | "Run a half-marathon in under 2 hours" |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |

### DOING (Experiences & Accomplishments)

What you want to do with time and mobility. These are the priorities.

| Experience | Estimated Cost | Monthly Cost (÷ months) |
|------------|----------------|------------------------|
| | $ | $ |
| | $ | $ |
| | $ | $ |
| | $ | $ |
| | $ | $ |

**Prompts to spark ideas:**
- What would you do if there were no way you could fail?
- What would you do with $100 million in the bank?
- What have you always wanted to experience?

## Part 3: Current Expenses Baseline

What you currently spend monthly on necessities:

| Category | Monthly Cost |
|----------|--------------|
| Housing (rent/mortgage) | $ |
| Utilities | $ |
| Food & groceries | $ |
| Transportation | $ |
| Insurance | $ |
| Subscriptions | $ |
| Other necessities | $ |
| **TOTAL Current Expenses** | **$** |

---

## Part 4: TMI Calculation

### Step 1: Dream Costs

Add up all monthly costs from Having + Doing (Being is already converted to Doing):

| Source | Monthly Cost |
|--------|--------------|
| HAVING (total) | $ |
| DOING (total) | $ |
| **SUBTOTAL A: Dream Costs** | **$** |

### Step 2: Living Expenses + Buffer

Current expenses × 1.3 (30% safety buffer):

| | Amount |
|--|--------|
| Current Monthly Expenses | $ |
| × 1.3 Buffer | × 1.3 |
| **SUBTOTAL B: Buffered Expenses** | **$** |

### Step 3: The Formula

```
TMI = SUBTOTAL A + SUBTOTAL B
TDI = TMI ÷ 30
```

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| **TMI (Target Monthly Income)** | **$** |
| **TDI (Target Daily Income)** | **$** |

---

## Part 5: Reality Check

### Current vs Target

| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Monthly Income | $ | $ (TMI) | $ |
| Daily Income | $ | $ (TDI) | $ |

### Gap Analysis

**If gap is small (< 20% increase needed):**
> You're closer than you think. Focus on optimization.

**If gap is medium (20-50% increase):**
> Achievable within 12 months with focused effort on highest-leverage activities.

**If gap is large (> 50% increase):**
> May need to extend timeline or re-prioritize dreams. Which items are truly essential?

---

## Part 6: Priority Ranking

Look at your DOING list. Rank by importance:

| Rank | Experience | Non-Negotiable? |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | | [ ] Yes |
| 2 | | [ ] Yes |
| 3 | | [ ] Yes |
| 4 | | [ ] |
| 5 | | [ ] |

**The top 3 non-negotiables drive your strategy.**

## Outputs Summary

This framework produces:

| Output | Description | Used In |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **TMI Number** | Monthly income target | [Annual Review](../reviews/annual/template.md), [Monthly Reviews](../reviews/monthly/template.md) |
| **TDI Number** | Daily income target | Daily revenue tracking |
| **Priority Experiences** | What matters most | [3-Year Goals](../goals/3_year.md), [Vivid Vision](vivid_vision.md) |
| **Gap Analysis** | Distance to goal | [Quarterly Planning](../interviews/honest_capacity_check.md) |

---

## When to Use

- **Primary**: Annual Review (recalculate yearly)
- **Update**: When circumstances change significantly
- **Reference**: Monthly Reviews (track progress toward TMI)
