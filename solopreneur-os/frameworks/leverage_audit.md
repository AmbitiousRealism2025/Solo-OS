# Leverage Audit Framework

> Reality check on AI and automation: What to kill, automate, and protect. **Timebox: 30-45 minutes.**

---

## Philosophy

- **The 2x Rule**: If AI takes longer than 2× manual (including debugging), it's productivity theater
- **Protect Your Edge**: Your unique taste, judgment, and empathy cannot be automated
- **Honest Assessment**: Most "AI workflows" are procrastination in disguise

---

## The Skill-Leverage Matrix

| Work Value | AI Strategy | Examples |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **$10/hr work** | KILL or AUTOMATE | Scheduling, data entry, formatting |
| **$100/hr work** | AUTOMATE (Cyborg/Centaur) | First drafts, research synthesis, tweaks |
| **$1,000/hr work** | AUGMENT (Cyborg) | Specialized consulting, strategy |
| **$10,000/hr work** | PROTECT (Human-Only) | Unique IP, high-stakes judgment, relationships |

---

## Part 1: Current Task Inventory

List your recurring tasks. Be honest about time spent.

| Task | Frequency | Time/Instance | Monthly Hours | Value Level |
|------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| | | | | $10 / $100 / $1k / $10k |
| | | | | $10 / $100 / $1k / $10k |
| | | | | $10 / $100 / $1k / $10k |
| | | | | $10 / $100 / $1k / $10k |
| | | | | $10 / $100 / $1k / $10k |
| | | | | $10 / $100 / $1k / $10k |
| | | | | $10 / $100 / $1k / $10k |
| | | | | $10 / $100 / $1k / $10k |

## Part 2: The Kill / Automate / Protect Sort

### KILL List

Tasks that don't move the needle on high-value work. Stop doing them entirely.

| Task | Why It Should Die | Hours Reclaimed |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### AUTOMATE List

The boring 30%. Rules-based, repetitive, low-judgment required.

| Task | Automation Method | Setup Time | Time Saved/Month |
|------|-------------------|------------|------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Automation Methods:**
- AI tool (specify which)
- Zapier/Make automation
- Template/SOP
- Hire/delegate
- Software (specify)

### PROTECT List

Deep empathy, rare taste, strategic insight, high-stakes judgment. Never automate.

| Task | Why It Must Stay Human | Value Created |
|------|------------------------|---------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

---

## Part 3: Cyborg vs Centaur Assessment

For tasks in the AUTOMATE list, choose your integration style.

### Centaur (Strategic Decoupling)

Divide-and-conquer: Clear "hand-off" points between human and AI.

**Best for:** Structured tasks with clear boundaries

| Task | Human Part | AI Part | Hand-off Point |
|------|------------|---------|----------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Example:** "AI writes draft, Human edits for tone"

### Cyborg (Deep Integration)

Intertwined: You + AI work together on every sub-step.

**Best for:** Creative/complex tasks with non-linear paths

| Task | Integration Style | Risk Level |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| | | Low / Medium / High |
| | | Low / Medium / High |

**Risk:** Drifting into AI-generated mediocrity. Monitor quality.

---

## Part 4: Productivity Theater Audit

Red flags that you're wasting time pretending to be productive.

### 2x Rule Check

For each AI-assisted task, calculate:

| Task | Manual Time | AI Time (Prompt + Monitor + Correct) | Ratio | Verdict |
|------|-------------|--------------------------------------|-------|---------|
| | min | min | x | Keep AI / Go Manual |
| | min | min | x | Keep AI / Go Manual |
| | min | min | x | Keep AI / Go Manual |

**Rule:** If AI Time > 2× Manual Time, stop using AI for that task.

### Workslop Check

High-volume, low-substance output that no one reads.

| Output | Who Actually Reads It? | Would Anyone Miss It? | Verdict |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| | | Yes / No | Keep / Kill |
| | | Yes / No | Keep / Kill |

### Skill Atrophy Check

| Skill | Still Practice Manually? | Last Manual Use | At Risk? |
|-------|--------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| | Yes / No | | Yes / No |
| | Yes / No | | Yes / No |

---

## Part 5: Honest Questions

Answer each:

1. **"If I had to do this manually today, how long would it take?"**
> 

2. **"Does the 10% human polish provide 90% of the value?"**
> 

3. **"Is this output actually useful, or just space-filler?"**
> 

4. **"Is my ability to do this manually degrading?"**
> 

5. **"Is this building a system that works while I sleep?"**
> 

---

## Outputs Summary

This framework produces:

| Output | Description | Used In |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Kill List** | Tasks to eliminate | [Weekly Reviews](../reviews/weekly/template.md) (stop doing) |
| **Automate List** | Tasks to systematize | [Energy Architecture](energy_architecture.md) |
| **Protect List** | Human-only work | [North Star](../north_star.md), pricing decisions |
| **Hours Reclaimed** | Time freed up | [Ideal Life Costing](ideal_life_costing.md) |

---

## When to Use

- **Primary**: Quarterly (as part of [Honest Capacity Check](../interviews/honest_capacity_check.md))
- **Trigger**: When feeling busy but unproductive
- **Update**: When adding new tools or workflows

---

## The Bottom Line

Leverage should free you to do MORE of your highest-value work, not just produce more low-value output faster.

**Test:** After implementing automations, are you spending MORE time on $1k-$10k/hr work? If not, something's wrong.
