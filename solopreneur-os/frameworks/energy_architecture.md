# Energy Architecture Framework

> Design your schedule around energy, not just time. **Timebox: 30-45 minutes.**

---

## Philosophy

- **Energy > Time**: An hour at peak focus ≠ an hour while depleted
- **Protect the Peak**: Your creative hours are finite and precious
- **Recovery is Investment**: Rest is not laziness—it's compounding

---

## Energy Types

| Type | Description | Best Activities |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Creative** | Deep work capacity, flow-state possible | Coding, writing, strategy, design |
| **Administrative** | Task-switching OK, lower cognitive load | Email, logistics, AI-assisted tasks, calls |
| **Recovery** | Deliberately off | Rest, reading, walks, family, nothing |

## Part 3: Energy Debt Diagnosis

### Warning Signs

- [ ] **Creative block**: Ideas feel forced, not flowing
- [ ] **Resentment**: Dreading work you used to enjoy

**Warning signs checked:** ______ / 6

**If 3+, you're in energy debt. Prioritize recovery.**

### Energy Drains

What's depleting you? List specific activities, people, or situations.

| Energy Drain | Frequency | Avoidable? |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| | Daily / Weekly / Monthly | Yes / No |
| | Daily / Weekly / Monthly | Yes / No |
| | Daily / Weekly / Monthly | Yes / No |
| | Daily / Weekly / Monthly | Yes / No |

### Energy Sources

What restores you? Be specific.

| Energy Source | Frequency | Easy to Access? |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| | Daily / Weekly / Monthly | Yes / No |
| | Daily / Weekly / Monthly | Yes / No |
| | Daily / Weekly / Monthly | Yes / No |

## Part 4: Recovery Strategies

### Conservation: "Hell Yeah or No"

For new commitments, apply the filter: Is this a "Hell Yeah"? If not, it's a No.

**Commitments to decline this month:**
1. 
2. 
3. 

### Recharge: Non-Negotiable Rituals

Define your recovery rituals. These are not optional.

| Ritual | Frequency | Duration | Non-Negotiable? |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Shutdown Ritual | Daily | min | [ ] |
| | | | [ ] |
| | | | [ ] |

### Alignment Check

Are your current projects aligned with your values? Misalignment drains energy.

| Project | Aligned with Values? | Energy Impact |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| | Yes / Partial / No | Gives / Neutral / Drains |
| | Yes / Partial / No | Gives / Neutral / Drains |
| | Yes / Partial / No | Gives / Neutral / Drains |

## Outputs Summary

This framework produces:

| Output | Description | Used In |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Peak Hours Map** | When to do creative work | Calendar, [Daily Reviews](../reviews/daily/template.md) |
| **Ideal Week Template** | Energy-aligned schedule | Weekly planning |
| **Energy Drains List** | What to eliminate | [Leverage Audit](leverage_audit.md) |
| **Recovery Rituals** | Non-negotiable recharge | Daily routine |
| **Active Project Limit** | What to pause | [Weekly Reviews](../reviews/weekly/template.md) |

---

## When to Use

- **Full Version**: Quarterly reset or when burned out
- **Light Check-in**: Weekly (are peak hours protected?)
- **Trigger**: 3+ warning signs, or feeling "busy but unproductive"

---

## The Bottom Line

You have limited creative energy each day. Every hour of peak focus spent on email or meetings is an hour stolen from your best work.

**The question is not "Do I have time?" but "Do I have energy?"**
