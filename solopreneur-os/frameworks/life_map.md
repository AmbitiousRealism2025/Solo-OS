# Life Map Framework

> Alex Lieberman's methodology: Personal EOS for making trade-offs visible. **Timebox: 45-60 minutes.**

---

## Philosophy

- **Trade-offs Visible**: A 10 in Career often hides a 3 in Relationships
- **Missing vs Maintenance**: Different problems require different energy
- **Ruthless Self-Honesty**: The only way this works

---

## The 6 Domains

| Domain | What It Covers |
|--------|----------------|
| **Career** | Professional growth, intellectual challenge, long-term trajectory |
| **Relationships** | Quality of connection with partner, family, close friends |
| **Health** | Physical vitality, mental well-being, energy levels |
| **Meaning** | Purpose, impact, alignment with core values |
| **Finances** | Financial security, wealth building, freedom from anxiety |
| **Fun** | Pure play, recreation, activities done solely for enjoyment |

---

## Part 1: Current State Audit

Score each domain honestly. First instinct. No editing.

**Scale**: 1 = Crisis, 5 = Functional, 10 = Thriving

| Domain | Score | One-Line Why |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Career** | /10 | |
| **Relationships** | /10 | |
| **Health** | /10 | |
| **Meaning** | /10 | |
| **Finances** | /10 | |
| **Fun** | /10 | |

**Lowest Score**: __________ (/10)
**Highest Score**: __________ (/10)

---

## Part 2: Domain Deep-Dive Questions

Answer for each domain. Be specific.

### Career

- Am I intellectually challenged?
> 

- Am I building a "personal moat" (unique skills/reputation)?
> 

- Am I working with people who make me better?
> 

### Relationships

- Am I a "kickass" partner/parent/friend?
> 

- Do I have friends I can be my full self with?
> 

- Am I present when I'm with the people I love?
> 

### Health

- Do I feel good waking up?
> 

- Do I have energy to sustain a 12-hour day if needed?
> 

- Is my "mental health stack" working?
> 

### Meaning

- If my work repeated for 100 years, would the world be better?
> 

- Does my daily effort align with my core values?
> 

- Am I making the impact I want to make?
> 

### Finances

- Am I secure enough to say "no" to things I don't want?
> 

- Is money working for me, or me for it?
> 

- Do I have clarity on my financial trajectory?
> 

### Fun

- When did I last do something just for the sake of it?
> 

- Am I "playing" enough?
> 

- What would I do if I had an unexpected free day?
>

## Part 3: The Road to 10

For each domain, answer: **"What would it take to make this a 10?"**

| Domain | What a 10 Looks Like | What's Missing |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| Career | | |
| Relationships | | |
| Health | | |
| Meaning | | |
| Finances | | |
| Fun | | |

---

## Part 4: Missing vs Maintenance Classification

Different problems need different energy.

### Classification Definitions

| Type | Definition | Energy Required |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| **Missing (Growth)** | Foundational element absent, score low (≤5) | High intensity, new habits, "building" energy |
| **Maintenance (Protection)** | Currently satisfied (≥8), needs ongoing effort | Consistency, SOPs, "protective" energy |

### Classify Each Domain

| Domain | Score | Classification | Action Type |
|--------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| Career | /10 | Missing / Maintenance | |
| Relationships | /10 | Missing / Maintenance | |
| Health | /10 | Missing / Maintenance | |
| Meaning | /10 | Missing / Maintenance | |
| Finances | /10 | Missing / Maintenance | |
| Fun | /10 | Missing / Maintenance | |

---

## Part 5: Prioritization

Choose **1-3 "Missing" domains** for the next 90 days. You cannot fix everything at once.

### Priority Domains

| Priority | Domain | Why Now | 90-Day Goal |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |

### What You're Intentionally Deprioritizing

List domains you're consciously not focusing on this quarter:

| Domain | Current Score | Acceptable? | Revisit When |
|--------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| | /10 | Yes / No | |
| | /10 | Yes / No | |

---

## Part 6: Quarterly Rocks

For each priority domain, define one tactical goal ("Rock") to move toward 10.

| Domain | Rock | Success Metric | Due Date |
|--------|------|----------------|----------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

## Outputs Summary

This framework produces:

| Output | Description | Used In |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Domain Scores** | Current state snapshot | [Annual Review](../reviews/annual/template.md) |
| **Gap Analysis** | What's missing per domain | [Quarterly Planning](../interviews/honest_capacity_check.md) |
| **Priority Domains** | Where to focus this quarter | [Monthly Reviews](../reviews/monthly/template.md) |
| **90-Day Rocks** | Specific tactical goals | [Weekly Reviews](../reviews/weekly/template.md) |
| **Maintenance List** | What to protect, not build | [Energy Architecture](energy_architecture.md) |

---

## When to Use

- **Full Version**: Annual Review (comprehensive scoring)
- **Light Check-in**: Quarterly (scores only, quick gut-check)
- **Reference**: Monthly Reviews (track Rocks progress)

---

## Process Flow Summary

```
1. VISION → Define what "10" looks like (10-Year Vision)
2. AUDIT → Score current status (1-10)
3. CLASSIFY → Mark each as "Missing" or "Maintenance"
4. PRIORITIZE → Choose 1-3 "Missing" domains for next 90 days
5. EXECUTE → Set "Rocks" (tactical goals) to move toward 10
```
