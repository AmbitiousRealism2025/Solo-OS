# Vivid Vision Framework

> Cameron Herold's methodology: A sensory-rich narrative of your life 3 years from now. **Timebox: 2-3 hours.**

---

## Philosophy

- **Present Tense**: Write as if it's already happened. "My revenue is..." not "My revenue will be..."
- **Destination, Not Roadmap**: No strategies or how-to steps. Only the end state.
- **Sensory Rich**: Make the reader (you) FEEL the excitement

---

## Setup Instructions

### Environment
- Go somewhere inspiring and distraction-free
- Not your desk. Coffee shop, park, library, anywhere new.
- Block 2-3 hours with no interruptions

### Mindset
- Imagine it's exactly 3 years from today
- Everything you wanted to happen, happened
- You're describing your current reality, not a dream

### Rules
- **Length**: 3-5 pages (shorter lacks detail; longer loses attention)
- **Tense**: Present ("I am..." "We have..." "Our clients...")
- **No "How"**: Only describe WHAT, never HOW you got there

## Part 1: The Big Picture

### Date 3 Years From Now
> _______________

### The One-Sentence Summary
In one sentence, what is your life about right now?
> 

### How I Feel

> 

---

## Part 2: Domain Narratives

Write 1-2 paragraphs for each domain. Present tense. Rich detail.

### Work & Career

What does your work look like? What problems do you solve? What "flow" do you achieve?

> 

### Finances & Freedom

What does your financial situation look like? What can you afford? What doesn't stress you anymore?

> 

### Health & Energy

How does your body feel? What's your routine? What have you let go of?

> 

### Relationships & People

Who are you spending time with? What do those relationships feel like? Who's no longer in your life?

> 

### Environment & Space

What does your workspace look like? Your home? Where do you live? What surrounds you?

> 

### Impact & Reputation

What do people say about you when you're not in the room? What are customers saying in testimonials? What does the media write about you?

> 

### Growth & Learning

What have you mastered? What are you learning now? How has your mind changed?

> 

### Fun & Adventure

What do you do for pure enjoyment? What adventures have you had? What's on your calendar for fun?

>
