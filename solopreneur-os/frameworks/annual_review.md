# Annual Review Framework

> Dr. Anthony Gustin's methodology: Reflection makes correct goals obvious. **Timebox: 3-5 hours.**

---

## Philosophy

- **Reflection over Goal-Setting**: Deep reflection makes correct goals obvious
- **Systems over Targets**: Build environments that make success inevitable
- **Cutting the Noise**: See patterns clearly and act decisively

---

## Pre-Review: Data Gathering

Before you start, collect these sources to spark memory:

| Source | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| **Calendar** | Every meeting, event, trip. Where did your time actually go? |
| **Photos** | Where you were, who you were with, how you felt |
| **Journals/Notes** | Internal state throughout the year |
| **Credit Card Statements** | Where money (priorities) actually went |
| **Email Sent Folder** | What you committed to, what you shipped |

Spend 30-60 minutes just reviewing these before filling anything out.

## Part 1: The Four Buckets

Categorize every major event, habit, or occurrence from the year.

### Wins

Accomplishments and moments of pride. What went right?

| Win | Why It Mattered |
|-----|-----------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |

### Losses

Mistakes, "anti-accomplishments," things that didn't go as planned.

| Loss | What Happened |
|------|---------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |

### Lessons

The "why" behind wins and losses. What did you learn?

| Lesson | Source (Win/Loss) |
|--------|-------------------|
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |

### Gratitudes

What you're thankful for—often people or opportunities.

| Gratitude | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
