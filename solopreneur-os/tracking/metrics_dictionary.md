## Energy Metrics

### Energy Level (1-10)

| Range | State | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **1-3** | Depleted | Running on fumes. No deep work possible. |
| **4-6** | Functional | Can execute, but not create. Good for admin. |
| **7-10** | Peak | High capacity. Save for your hardest problems. |

### Energy Type

| Type | Definition | Best For |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Creative** | Deep work capacity. Flow-state possible. | Coding, writing, strategy, design |
| **Administrative** | Task-switching OK. Lower cognitive load. | Email, logistics, AI-assisted tasks, calls |
| **Depleted** | Recovery mode. Deliberately off. | Rest, reading, walks, nothing |

---

## Mode Types

| Mode | Definition | Typical Activities |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Client** | Paid work requiring your presence | Consulting, deliverables, calls, projects |
| **Creator** | Building your own things | Content, products, courses, personal projects |
| **Recovery** | Rest. Not laziness—investment. | Time off, recharge, deliberately nothing |

**Weekly Target**: Know your ideal Client:Creator ratio. Track it.

## Revenue Types

| Type | Definition | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Active Income** | Requires your presence to earn | Consulting, coaching, live workshops |
| **Ambient Revenue** | Runs without you | Products, courses, affiliate, licensing |

**Goal**: Increase Ambient Revenue percentage over time.

## Learning Types

| Type | Definition | Signal |
|------|------------|--------|
| **R&D** | Productive exploration with clear hypothesis | Has a deadline. Has a test. Will ship something. |
| **Procrastination** | Shiny object syndrome disguised as learning | No deadline. No test. "Just exploring." |

**The Test**: Would you invest $1,000 of your own money in this learning experiment?

---

## Time Tracking

### Client vs Creator Hours

Track weekly:
- **Client Hours**: Time spent on paid work
- **Creator Hours**: Time spent on your own projects
- **Ratio**: Client:Creator (e.g., 60:40)

### The Barbell Strategy

| Category | Allocation | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Cash Cow** | 70-80% | High-paying, low-uncertainty client work |
| **Moonshots** | 20-30% | High-uncertainty, high-leverage personal projects |
| **Avoid** | 0% | "Average" projects (moderate pay, high energy, no content value) |

---

## Output Tracking

### What Counts as "Shipped"

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Code** | Features deployed, bugs fixed, PRs merged |
| **Content** | Posts published, videos uploaded, newsletters sent |
| **Client** | Deliverables sent, milestones completed |

### What Doesn't Count

- Research without output
- Planning without execution
- "Thinking about" without deciding

## Pattern Tags

Use these sparingly. See [Tag Index](tag_index.md) for definitions.

| Tag | When to Use |
|-----|-------------|
| `#signal` | Raw observation worth tracking |
| `#pattern` | Recurring cluster (3+ instances) |
| `#experiment` | Hypothesis being tested |
| `#decision` | Irreversible-ish choice made |

---

## Usage Rules

1. **Don't overthink ratings**. First instinct is usually right.
2. **Consistency > Precision**. A "7" today should mean the same as a "7" next month.
3. **Track what you'll use**. If you never look at a metric, stop tracking it.
4. **Lock definitions before templates**. Changing these breaks historical data.
