## Memory System Tags

| Tag | Definition | Promotion Path |
|-----|------------|----------------|
| `#signal` | Raw observation worth tracking. Single instance. | Capture daily → Review weekly |
| `#pattern` | Recurring cluster. Seen 3+ times with evidence. | Promoted from signals monthly |
| `#experiment` | Hypothesis being tested. Has stop condition. | Created from patterns |
| `#decision` | Irreversible-ish choice. Documented rationale. | Created from experiments or directly |

### Signal → Pattern Promotion Criteria

A signal becomes a pattern when:
- Observed 3+ times
- Has identifiable trigger
- Has measurable impact
- Suggests actionable response

## Usage Rules

1. **Fewer tags = better**. If you can't remember a tag exists, it shouldn't.
2. **One purpose per tag**. No overlapping definitions.
3. **Tags describe, not categorize**. Use folders for categories.
4. **Review quarterly**. Delete unused tags.

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't Do | Why |
|----------|-----|
| `#important` | Everything feels important. Useless. |
| `#todo` | Use task lists, not tags |
| `#read-later` | Creates guilt pile. Process or delete. |
| Project-specific tags | Use project folders instead |
