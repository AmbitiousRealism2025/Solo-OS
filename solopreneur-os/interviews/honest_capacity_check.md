# Honest Capacity Check

> Quarterly reality check on what you can actually handle. **Timebox: 20-30 minutes.**

## Purpose

Prevent over-commitment and burnout. Check if your current load matches your actual capacity—not your aspirational capacity.

---

## Instructions

- Complete quarterly, or when feeling overwhelmed
- Be ruthlessly honest. No one sees this but you.
- Use "WHAT" questions, not "WHY"
- End with concrete decisions, not insights

## The Hard Truth

You cannot do everything. Saying yes to something always means saying no to something else.

**The question is not "Can I fit this in?" but "What am I sacrificing to fit this in?"**

If you regularly have negative margin, you're borrowing against your future self. That debt compounds.
