# Identity & Values Interview

> Self-interview for extracting core values. **Timebox: 30-45 minutes.**

## Purpose

Surface your actual values—not the ones you think you should have. Values drive decisions. Unclear values lead to scattered decisions.

---

## Instructions

- Answer quickly. Overthinking leads to "should" answers, not true answers.
- Look for patterns, not perfection
- Values aren't goals—they're operating principles
- Complete this during Annual Review or when feeling directionless
