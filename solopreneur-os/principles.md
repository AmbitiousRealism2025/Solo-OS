# Principles

> Operating constraints that make decisions easier. Not values—rules.

## System Principles

These govern how this operating system works.

### 1. Honesty Over Comfort

This system only works if you tell it the truth. Track what actually happened, not what you wish happened.

### 2. Timeboxes Are Sacred

- Daily Check-In: **≤5 minutes**
- Weekly Review: **≤60 minutes**
- Monthly Review: **≤2 hours**
- Annual Review: **≤half day**

If a review takes longer, cut content. Don't extend time.

### 3. Outputs Over Inputs

Every template ends with a decision, artifact, or commitment. Reflection without output is journaling, not operating.

### 4. No Backfilling

Missed a daily? Skip it. Start today. Backfilling creates guilt spirals and false data. The system tracks forward, not backward.

### 5. Minimum Viable Answers

First instinct answers are fine. Overthinking a daily check-in defeats the purpose. Save deep thinking for weekly/monthly reviews.

## Work Principles

These govern how you work as a solopreneur.

### 6. Protect Peak Energy

Your creative hours are finite and precious. Don't spend them on email, calls, or tasks AI can handle. See [Energy Architecture](frameworks/energy_architecture.md).

### 7. Ship Over Perfect

Done is better than perfect. Iteration beats planning. The market gives better feedback than your imagination.

### 8. Recovery Is Productive

Rest is investment, not laziness. Energy debt compounds. Scheduled recharge beats burnout recovery.

### 9. Say No by Default

Every yes is a no to something else. Good opportunities kill great ones. Your time is more limited than your ambition.

### 10. Track What You'll Use

Don't track metrics you won't review. Don't set goals you won't measure. Measurement overhead costs energy.

## Anti-Principles

Things that sound like principles but aren't.

| Don't Use | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| "Work hard" | Not actionable. Leads to burnout, not output. |
| "Be authentic" | Too vague. Authenticity isn't a decision-making tool. |
| "Follow your passion" | Passion follows mastery, not the reverse. |
| "Move fast and break things" | Fine for startups, not for solo practitioners with reputation to protect. |

## Using Principles

When facing a decision:

1. State the decision clearly
2. Check which principles apply
3. Follow the principle, even if it's uncomfortable
4. If principles conflict, choose the higher-numbered one (they're roughly prioritized)
