# Friction Log

> Track pain points with the read-only UI. When **3+ recurring items** demand features VitePress cannot provide, trigger Phase 4 (Next.js migration).

---

## How to Use This Log

1. **Record friction** as you encounter it during daily/weekly use
2. **Be specific** about what's frustrating and why
3. **Assess** whether VitePress can fix it (custom Vue component) or if Phase 4 is needed
4. **Don't trigger Phase 4 prematurely** - give VitePress a fair shot (2+ weeks of use)

## Phase 4 Trigger Checklist

Before proceeding to Phase 4, verify ALL of these:

- [ ] **3+ friction items** are marked "Phase 4 Needed = Yes"
- [ ] Items are **RECURRING** (not one-time annoyances)
- [ ] You've used the system for **2+ weeks** (fair trial)
- [ ] VitePress custom components **cannot** solve the problem
- [ ] Estimated value of Phase 4 **exceeds** migration cost (1-2 weeks of work)
- [ ] You're prepared to maintain **two systems temporarily** during migration

## Friction Categories

### View Friction (VitePress might fix)
- "Need a calendar view of daily reviews"
- "Want a graph visualization of patterns"
- Custom Vue components can often solve these

### Entry Friction (Phase 4 needed)
- "Daily check-in form would be faster than editing markdown"
- "Want validation on energy field (1-10 only)"
- Requires forms, input handling → Phase 4

### Computation Friction (Phase 4 needed)
- "Want auto-aggregated weekly stats from daily entries"
- "Need to see client/creator ratio calculated automatically"
- Requires data processing → Phase 4

### Write Friction (Phase 4 needed)
- "Want to edit markdown from the UI directly"
- "Need to create new daily files from UI"
- Requires write-back → Phase 4

## Notes

- **Remember**: The markdown vault works without any UI. Phase 4 is a convenience, not a necessity.
- **Ambitious Realism**: Dream big (full PWA), stay honest (only build what's actually needed).
- **The goal is using the system, not building the system.**
